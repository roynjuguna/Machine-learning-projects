# Machine Learning Projects Repository

Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects Repository! This repository features a selection of machine learning projects I've developed, each with unique objectives and datasets to tackle different real-world issues. Below is an outline of the included projects, their datasets, and the approaches used.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Tanzania's Waterpoint Operational Status Prediction
- **Objective**: Predict the operational status of waterpoints across Tanzania.
- **Dataset**: Contains data on waterpoints, including GPS coordinates, funding details, installation year, and population served.
- **Modeling Approach**: Feature engineering and XGBoost classification.
- **Outcome**: A model that aids in identifying non-functional waterpoints, supporting resource allocation and maintenance prioritization.

### 2. Spam Mail Detection
- **Objective**: Classify emails as either spam or non-spam.
- **Dataset**: A labeled collection of email texts with spam and non-spam tags.
- **Modeling Approach**: Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and logistic regression.
- **Outcome**: An efficient classifier that helps filter spam emails for improved email management.

### 3. Diabetes Prediction
- **Objective**: Predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on health data.
- **Dataset**: Health records containing features like glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, and age.
- **Modeling Approach**: Logistic regression and XGBoost for binary classification.
- **Outcome**: A model that assists in identifying at-risk individuals, supporting early intervention and diabetes management.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ml-projects-repo.git
   cd ml-projects-repo
   ```

2. **Installation**:
   Install the required packages with:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Datasets**:
   Each project folder includes instructions for downloading and setting up the datasets. Place data files in the respective project directories before running the code.

4. **Run the Notebooks**:
   Open each project's Jupyter Notebook or `.py` scripts for a step-by-step guide.
